= Why can't any PSOPC users seem to connect to my server? =
Sylverant does not allow users of PSOPC to connect to the server unless they have been previously registered. This decision was made for two reasons: firstly, its my belief that very few PSOPC users will probably be using actual real serial number/access key pairs, and secondly (building off of the first reason) due to how Sylverant doles out Guild Cards to unknown clients. With a blank serial number/access key, all PSOPC clients will be given the same guild card number, which will cause some obvious problems.

In order for a PSOPC client to connect, they must have an entry in the dreamcast_clients table of the database (and an assigned guildcard from an entry in the guildcards table). This entry should have the serial number of the client and the access key filled in (convert the serial from decimal to hex) and a dcid of '0'.

= What commands are available to users on Sylverant? =
Here is the list of currently available commands for regular users on the Sylverant ship server:
  * /save `[`slot`]` -- Save the current character data to the server for backup purposes. `[`slot`]` is required and can be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). This command can only be executed in a default lobby, not a game lobby.
  * /restore `[`slot`]` -- Restore the character data from the given slot on the server (saved previously with /save). Be careful when using this command as PSOPC doesn't seem to like you restoring a character that isn't the same as the one you came on the game with. `[`slot`]` is required and can be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). This command can only be executed in a default lobby, not a game lobby.
  * /minlvl `[`level`]` -- Set the minimum required level for the current game lobby. `[`level`]` is required, and must be greater than or equal to the level specified by the game for the difficulty of the game. This command only affects new clients attempting to enter the game, and will not kick anyone currently in the game out. This command can only be executed in a game lobby, not a default lobby. Also, this command is only available to the current team leader.
  * /maxlvl `[`level`]` -- Set the maximum allowed level for the current game lobby. `[`level`]` is required, and must be greater than or equal to the minimum level for the current game lobby. This command only affects new clients attempting to enter the game, and will not kick anyone currently in the game out. This command can only be executed by the team leader and only in a game lobby.

= What additional commands are available to GMs on Sylverant? =
  * /kill `[`guildcard`]` -- Kick the specified user from the server. `[`guildcard`]` is a required field and must be a numeric guild card number. This *does not* ban the user from the server.
  * /warp `[`area`]` -- Warp to the specified map. `[`area`]` is a required field, and must be between 0 and 17. This command does not work on PSOv1. Although you can execute this command on a non-game lobby (currently), it is not recommended to do so.
  * /refresh `[`what`]` -- Refresh some server data. `[`what`]` is a required field and must either be the string "gms" or "quests" (currently). It should be obvious what each does.
