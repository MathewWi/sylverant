= Why can't any PSOPC users seem to connect to my server? =
Sylverant does not allow users of PSOPC to connect to the server unless they have been previously registered. This decision was made for two reasons: firstly, its my belief that very few PSOPC users will probably be using actual real serial number/access key pairs, and secondly (building off of the first reason) due to how Sylverant doles out Guild Cards to unknown clients. With a blank serial number/access key, all PSOPC clients will be given the same guild card number, which will cause some obvious problems.

In order for a PSOPC client to connect, they must have an entry in the dreamcast_clients table of the database (and an assigned guildcard from an entry in the guildcards table). This entry should have the serial number of the client and the access key filled in (convert the serial from decimal to hex) and a dcid of '0'.

= What commands are available to users on Sylverant? =
Here is the list of currently available commands for regular users on the Sylverant ship server:
  * /save `[`slot`]` -- Save the current character data to the server for backup purposes. `[`slot`]` is required and can be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). This command can only be executed in a default lobby, not a game lobby.
  * /restore `[`slot`]` -- Restore the character data from the given slot on the server (saved previously with /save). Be careful when using this command as PSOPC doesn't seem to like you restoring a character that isn't the same as the one you came on the game with. `[`slot`]` is required and can be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). This command can only be executed in a default lobby, not a game lobby.
  * /minlvl `[`level`]` -- Set the minimum required level for the current game lobby. `[`level`]` is required, and must be greater than or equal to the level specified by the game for the difficulty of the game. This command only affects new clients attempting to enter the game, and will not kick anyone currently in the game out. This command can only be executed in a game lobby, not a default lobby. Also, this command is only available to the current team leader.
  * /maxlvl `[`level`]` -- Set the maximum allowed level for the current game lobby. `[`level`]` is required, and must be greater than or equal to the minimum level for the current game lobby. This command only affects new clients attempting to enter the game, and will not kick anyone currently in the game out. This command can only be executed by the team leader and only in a game lobby.
  * /bstat -- Get the number of players and games currently active on the block that you are on. This can be used in a game lobby or a default lobby.
  * /arrow `[`colornumber`]` -- Set the arrow above your head in the lobby (0 = off, max is 10).

= What additional commands are available to GMs on Sylverant? =
  * /kill `[`guildcard`]` -- Kick the specified user from the server. `[`guildcard`]` is a required field and must be a numeric guild card number. This *does not* ban the user from the server.
  * /warp `[`area`]` -- Warp to the specified map. `[`area`]` is a required field, and must be between 0 and 17. This command does not work on PSOv1. Although you can execute this command on a non-game lobby (currently), it is not recommended to do so.
  * /refresh `[`what`]` -- Refresh some server data. `[`what`]` is a required field and must either be the string "gms" or "quests" (currently). It should be obvious what each does.
  * /bcast `[`message`]` -- Send a global message to all players on the current ship.
  * /login `[`username`]` `[`password`]` -- Login as a global GM, granting full GM privileges on the ship if login is successful.
  * /item `[`item1`]`,`[`item2`]`,`[`item3`]`,`[`item4`]` -- Set the next item that will be generated when *your character* hits a box. `[`item1`]` is the only strictly necessary argument here, the rest will default to 0. Note, these are all 32-bit hex values. If you change your mind, to clear it out, make `[`item1`]` be 0 by using this command again. There are only commas between the arguments, no spaces!
  * /item4 `[`item4`]` -- Set the 4th 32-bit hex value for the next item to be generated. Most versions of PSO don't give you enough space to put in all 4 things in the above command, if you need to use all digits, but you will have enough for at least 3. This is to set the last one, if you run out of room.
